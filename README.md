Demeter / Δημητηρ
==================

    > εἰμὶ δὲ Δημήτηρ τιμάοχος, ἥτε μέγιστον 
    > ἀθανάτοις θνητοῖς τ᾽ ὄνεαρ καὶ χάρμα τέτυκται.

Demeter is a configurable data-harvesting application.

Synopis
--------

    demeter -e my-config

Description
------------

Demeter allows the user to specify common data-downloading
operations through configuration and convention as much as
possible, while still allowing the user to drop down to code
to accomplish actions that cannot be represented in configuration.

Usage
-----

Demeter requires a configuration file to be really useful. You can see
some examples of them in the `config` directory. These should be _YAML_
documents.

INSTALLATION
---------------

You do not need to install this application to use it. If you do want
to install it, you can do so with the following commands.

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------

The documentation is a bit patchy, and could do with some improvement. You can try
your luck with perldoc.

A better bet is contacting the author (alexkalderimis at gmail.com), or
the intermine development list (dev at intermine.org), where this code is maintained.
